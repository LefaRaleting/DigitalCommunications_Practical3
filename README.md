# DigitalCommunications_Practical3
Develop two similation platforms to encode and decode BPSK-modulated information through and AWGN channel (no multipath). Use the BPSK simulation platform developed in Practical 1 to develop the simulation platforms to generate uncoded data blocks of length Nu = 100.
